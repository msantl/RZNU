Starting hadoop:
    /usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/2.6.0/libexec/sbin/start-dfs.sh
    /usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/2.6.0/libexec/sbin/start-yarn.sh

Check hadoop status:
    jps

Get classpath:
    /usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/2.6.0/libexec/bin/hadoop classpath

# from here on it would be good to be in /usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/2.6.0/libexec/bin/
